1
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:10,425
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea,

2
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,705
through a series of channels
called bronchi,

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:17,050
and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,980
There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs,

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,410
adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters—

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,440
the size of a tennis court.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,690
These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange:

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,729
allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,710
and clearing out carbon dioxide.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,550
Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,820
Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,140
There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,010
The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,403
These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe,

15
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,823
or when we touch our eyes, noses,

16
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,293
or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface.

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:04,293
Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense:

18
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,293
the mucociliary escalator.

19
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:10,896
The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs

20
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:15,461
called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out.

21
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:18,761
But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator

22
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,821
into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli.

23
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:24,311
Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points

24
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,691
between the blood and air 
from the outside world,

25
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:31,157
they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages,

26
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:35,756
which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them.

27
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:40,485
When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them.

28
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:45,439
The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help.

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,049
As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation—

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,819
and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation.

31
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,359
When this fluid builds up,

32
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,979
it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult.

33
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,639
As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise,

34
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,363
the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in.

35
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:09,143
This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia.

36
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:14,298
The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing.

37
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,038
Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult,

38
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:20,778
but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics,

39
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:25,352
which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments.

40
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:29,270
Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control.

41
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,220
As the pathogen is cleared out,

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,659
the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells.

43
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,589
The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week,

44
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:42,029
though full recovery may take 
as long as a month.

45
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,709
Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home.

46
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,879
But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe,

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,499
requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation,

48
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:56,499
or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection.

49
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,459
Smoking damages the cilia,

50
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,139
making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions,

51
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,919
let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia.

52
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,589
Genetic and autoimmune disorders

53
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:11,699
can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia.

54
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,989
Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance

55
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,659
and weaker immune systems.

56
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,509
And if someone has viral pneumonia,

57
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,509
their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher.

58
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,269
Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare.

59
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,759
But sometimes, even with appropriate care,

60
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,669
the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain,

61
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,699
activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body,

62
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,739
not just in the lungs.

63
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,719
This is actually a protective mechanism,

64
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,319
but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down,

65
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,899
causing shock and sometimes death.

66
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:48,939
So how can we prevent pneumonia?

67
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,639
Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise

68
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,219
helps your body fight off infections.

69
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,579
Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens,

70
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,669
while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens—

71
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,159
and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.
